    Being that a huge goal of mine is to pursue game development, whether professionally or personally, I need to establish a strong fundamental basis. Thus, I made a goal to re-create one of my all-time favourite games "The Binding of Issac".

## Important Note
Due to my barely passable drawing skills alot of the sprites for the re-creation were taken from the original game "The Binding of Issac: Rebirth". I used an online website that posted these extracted sprites, hence all creditation goes to those wonderful individuals 
who took the time to extract the various arts pieces of the game. https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/bindingofisaacrebirth/

My desire was to evolve my understanding of game development and coding using C# by building from scratch the popular dungeon crawler game "The Binding of Issac"

<!-- HISTORY -->
## History

To begin, lets briefly describe the game and the history of its creation. Binding of Issac is a roguelike (a style of game that traditionally involves a player going through procedurally generated levels and usually had permanent death of the player) video game. It is a top-down shooter that has the player going through various rooms within a level, defeating enemies and obtaining items and proceeding to the next level upon eliminating the boss of the level. 
The game originally created by Edmund McMillen (designer and story-creation) & Florian Himsl (programmer) was the results of a week-long game jam. Edmund is actually known for another title he designed called “Super Meat Boy”. The goal of the game was intended to dive into “touchy” subjects in regards to religion, hence McMillen had expected the game to fail. 
McMillien wanted to incorporate the procedural generation inspired by “The Legend of Zelda” game’s dungeon structure.
